## Problem Statement
* Voting and transperancy are the backbone of any democracy. Traditional voting system like balllots, voting machines etc are susceptible to vote tampering by attacks on poll booths, hacking the machine etc. Due to various past tampering incidents people are lossing their trust in democracy. 
* These methods are highly incovinent for the citizens to vote which reduces the overall number of voters. According to a study this is a main reason for decline in voters by 10%. By using blockchain we aim to solve this problem.
