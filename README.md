## Problem Statement
* Voting and transperancy are the backbone of any democracy. Traditional voting system like balllots, voting machines etc are susceptible to vote tampering by attacks on poll booths, hacking the machine etc. Due to various past tampering incidents people are lossing their trust in democracy. 
* These methods are highly incovinent for the citizens to vote which reduces the overall number of voters. According to a study this is a main reason for decline in voters by 10%. By using blockchain we aim to solve this problem.

## Our Solution
* Our solution is a decentralized web app where a citizen can vote from his/her home and make their contribution.
*  All a person need is a device which is connected to their crypto walllet, put in the poll id and vote for their candidate.
* Government just have to create a poll with a description and then can share the poll id with everyone.

## Advantages of our solution
* Besides using blockchain there will a significant reduction in expenditure as there will be no need for ballots, machines, physicals locations, transportation and counting personnel. 
* All the data is decentralized so it is no more susceptible data breach.
* It will make voting more accessible as the citizens are no longer required to travel somewhere to vote.
* As all the data is stored on blockchain it will bring more trust, transparency and validity in voting system.
